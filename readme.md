# pluto
### What is pluto?
pluto is my personal discord bot I wrote in order to help me "manage" my server a bit better and just wanting to code a discord bot in general.
And who knows, maybe it will be a public bot in the future.
 
### pluto's functionalities
1. Clearing messages.
2. Showing avatars of users in the same discord server with him.
3. Showing the users account information.
4. Adjusting his prefix to your liking.
5. Playing your favorite music (it's a bit scuffed right now but I'm working on a better solution).
6. Saying hello :)

### Commands that you can't use
1. Token (showing the bots token).
2. Restarting the bot.
3. Activity and status commands

### What pluto won't do
1. Explain the aerodynamics of a cow.
