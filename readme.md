### What is pluto?
pluto is my personal discord bot I wrote in order to help me "manage" my server a bit better and just wanting to code a discord bot in general.
And who knows, maybe it will be a public bot in the future.
 
### pluto's functionalities
1. Clearing messages.
2. Showing avatars of users in the same discord server with him.
3. Showing the users account information.
4. Adjusting his prefix to your liking.
5. Playing your favorite music (it's a bit scuffed right now but I'm working on a better solution).
6. Saying hello :)

### Commands that you can't use
1. Token (showing the bots token).
2. Restarting the bot.
3. Activity and status commands

### What pluto won't do
1. Explain the aerodynamics of a cow.

## Planned features
### Scanning files
<details>
    <summary>Virustotal API</summary>

#### Explained: You run the command "{prefix}scan" the bot then says that you have to send the file you want to have scanned, you send the file and then after a few minutes, it will give you the link to the scan-result.

### Music functionality
<details>
    <summary>Spotify / Youtube</summary>

#### Right now, the bot downloads the song/video from youtube and puts it in a folder on my pc, it uses the same internet connection I'm using, therefore it can be a bit slow.
#### I haven't tried Spotify yet, no clue if it's even possible but it's worth a try. Or I can just rewrite my current code which is more likely what I'm going to do.

### Chat log
<details>
    <summary>Logging deleted messages</summary>

#### I already have that but the log channel is defined within the code, planned is to set the log channel with a command. :)
