# Pluto Discord Bot

## What is Pluto?
Pluto is a personal Discord bot designed to manage servers, provide fun and utility commands, and automate common tasks. Originally for personal use, Pluto has grown to include a wide range of features and may become public in the future.

## Features

### Moderation
- **Kick/Ban Members**: Remove problematic users from your server.
